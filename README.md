## Overview

StellarView Explorer gives you a fast, clean window into the Stellar blockchain. Browse ledgers, transactions, accounts, assets, and Soroban smart contracts across **Public**, **Testnet**, and **Futurenet** — all in one place.

The app is **live today**, powered entirely by the Stellar Horizon API and Soroban RPC.

This repository holds the **web app** only. StellarView Explorer also ships a custom indexer and a terminal client, each in their own repository:

| Repo | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`StellarViewOrg/indexer`](https://github.com/StellarViewOrg/indexer) | Go service that ingests Stellar network data into PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, with real-time event publishing via Redis |
| [`StellarViewOrg/tui`](https://github.com/StellarViewOrg/tui) | Terminal client (alpha) plus its dedicated `tui-indexer` backend |
| [`StellarViewOrg/docs`](https://github.com/StellarViewOrg/docs) | Astro/Starlight documentation site |

## Architecture

![System Architecture](./docs/diagrams/architecture.svg)
> Own elaboration

The Explorer Web app reads live data directly from the **Stellar Horizon API** and **Soroban RPC** — no intermediate backend required. The **Custom Indexer** (see [`StellarViewOrg/indexer`](https://github.com/StellarViewOrg/indexer)) enriches the TUI and future web analytics with historical depth and real-time streaming.

## Getting Started

### Quick start — Explorer Web

```bash
bun install            # Install workspace dependencies
bun run dev:web        # Start frontend at http://localhost:3000
```

That's it. The frontend runs fully against the public Horizon API — no local backend required.

For the indexer, TUI, or docs site, see their dedicated repos linked above — each has its own setup instructions.

---

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev:web` | Start frontend development server |
| `bun run build:web` | Build the frontend |
| `bun run lint:web` | Lint the frontend |
| `bun run test:web` | Run frontend tests |
| `bun run format:web` | Format the frontend |

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (Frontend)

Point the Vercel project to `apps/explorer-web` as the Root Directory. This isolates the production build from the rest of the monorepo.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Framework Preset | `Next.js` |
| Root Directory | `apps/explorer-web` |
| Install Command | _(leave default — Vercel detects the Bun workspace)_ |
| Build Command | `bun run build` |
| Output Directory | _(leave empty)_ |
